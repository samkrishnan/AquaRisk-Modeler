# AquaRisk-Modeler
A tool for modeling and analyzing Drinking Water Pipe Risk based on Excel -VBA 
This type is inteneded to help drinking water utilities model the risk associated with the various factors that affect 
their drinking water pipes.  It is a partial asset management tool in that it requires data about the system.

After the tool is made available, we will include a help file that will detail how tool can be used.
NOTE - WE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THIS AND MAKE IT USEFUL FOR RISK ANALSYSIS.
